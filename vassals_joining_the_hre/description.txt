With this mod, you will be able to have your vassals join the HRE! Every so often, an event will fire that will make one of your vassals into a HRE prince instead. This is intended to be a balanced way of adding more princes to your vassal swarm through diplomacy.

Requirements for the event to trigger:
[list]
    [*] You need to be emperor
    [*] You need to have at least 10 Imperial Authority
    [*] Your vassal must be outside the HRE
    [*] Your vassal must have less than 800 total development
    [*] Your vassal must have 100 opinion of you
    [*] Your vassal must have a neighbour country that is already in the HRE - or be an island nation
[/list]

Mean time to happen: 6 months.

[i]If you want to cheat your way to this event, all you need to do is open the console and type in:
