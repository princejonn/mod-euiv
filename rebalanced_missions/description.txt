The purpose of this mod is pretty simple: I can't be bothered timing the mission modifiers to a perfect moment, so I figure it's maybe better then to let all mission modifiers be active indefinitely (until the end of game). Is this balanced? Nope. Does it give peace of mind? Yep. I'm also switching out some Permanent Claims for Cores instead since I believe that's what the country would have been arguing for.
