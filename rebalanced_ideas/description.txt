The basic ideas in EUIV are pretty well balanced imho. However, there are a few details that need tweaking to be great.

In this mod I aim to rebalance the ideas and have them make slightly more sense. Changes below:

[list]
  [*] Add another pronoiar to Administrative ideas.
  [*] Add another diplomatic relation slot to Diplomatic ideas.
  [*] Allow AI subjects to take Exploration ideas, so that they start expanding their (or your) colonnial empire.
[/list]
