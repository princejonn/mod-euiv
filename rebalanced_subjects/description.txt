I'm kind of a sucker for having subjects. They are fun to play around with, and add some depth to the gameplay. It's fun to use them in wars, and it's fun to see them grow. But I feel like they are a bit underwhelming. They are not as powerful as they should be, and they are not as fun to play around with as they could be.

In this mod I'm aiming to fix and rebalance a couple of things that deal with subjects.

[list]
  [*] Viceroyalty (see below)
  [*] Incorporated and Consolidated Personal Unions (see below)
  [*] Incorporated Vassals (see below)
  [*] South Africa is now a colonial region.
  [*] Subjects are now allowed to use the decisions to form new nations when they are eligible to do so.
[/list]

[h2]Viceroyalty[/h2]
I felt like something was missing somewhere between full annexation and personal union. Viceroyalties seemed to fit this spot pretty well. Historically they were regions under more autonomous leadership.

[list]
  [*] You establish viceroyalties in a sector once you've reached a province ownership threshold. Depending on the sector size, this can be: 5, 10, or 20.
  [*] You need to be in the western technology group.
  [*] You need to have admin tech: 12 (Early Modern Administration).
  [*] The decision costs 300 admin power and 300 diplomatic power.
  [*] You can only establish a Viceroyalty once every 2 years (It takes time and effort to establish one).
  [*] Viceroyalties will take ownership of all provinces in the sector it is established in.
  [*] If you conquer more land in the sector, it will go to the Viceroyalty.
  [*] It does not take up a diplomatic slot.
  [*] It will have much lower liberty desire than unions or vassals.
  [*] Viceroyalties cannot be inherited. You are already the owner.
  [*] You have access to (almost) all subject interactions that the game offers.
  [*] Viceroyalties are military dictatorships.
[/list]

[h3]Sector[/h3]
A sector is a group of provinces that are loosely connected to in game regions and areas, or somewhat related to countries. I've basically just played around with what felt reasonable as well as what a colonial empire might have done.

[h3]Establish Diplomatically[/h3]
If you already have a vassal that owns a vast majority of the required provinces (all but 2 are required), you can establish a viceroyalty from that vassal as long as the conditions are met.

[list]
  [*] You need to be in the western technology group.
  [*] The decision costs 300 admin power and 300 diplomatic power.
  [*] You can only establish a Viceroyalty once every 2 years (It takes time and effort to establish one).
  [*] Your subject will take ownership of all provinces in the sector that you own.
  [*] Your subject will cede all provinces outside the sector back to you.
[/list]

[h2]Incorporated and Consolidated Personal Unions[/h2]
I wanted to create a path where you slowly move the integration process forward for your Personal Union. I used the Incorporation basline from the Austria Mission Tree and continued down the path.

[list]
  [*] You need to have admin tech: 12 (Early Modern Administration).
  [*] You access this feature from the Diplomatic window under: Influence.
  [*] You can only do this once every 5 years.
  [*] Consolidated Personal Unions can be created from Incorporated Personal Unions. For this you will need diplomatic tech 15.
  [*] Incorporated and Consolidated Personal Unions have a greater chance of being inherited on monarch death, but it can only happen every 5 years to reduce cheesing.
[/list]

[h2]Incorporated Vassals[/h2]
I'm enabling incorporated vassals via diplomatic influence locked behind technology and subject approval.

[list]
  [*] You need to have admin tech: 12 (Early Modern Administration).
  [*] You access this feature from the Diplomatic window under: Influence.
  [*] You can only do this once every year.
[/list]

[h2]Forming Unions with Vassals[/h2]
I'm enabling a way to form a personal union with your vassal via diplomatic influence locked behind technology and subject approval.

[list]
  [*] You need to have admin tech: 12 (Early Modern Administration).
  [*] You access this feature from the Diplomatic window under: Influence.
  [*] You can only do this once every three years.
[/list]
