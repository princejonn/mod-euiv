I'm kind of a sucker for having subjects. They are fun to play around with, and add some depth to the gameplay. It's fun to use them in wars, and it's fun to see them grow. But I feel like they are a bit underwhelming. They are not as powerful as they should be, and they are not as fun to play around with as they could be.

In this mod I'm aiming to fix and rebalance a couple of things that deal with subjects.

[h2]Features[/h2]
[list]
  [*] Fiefs
  [*] Protectorates
  [*] Client States
  [*] Viceroyalties
  [*] Subject Incorporation
  [*] Forming Unions with Vassals
  [*] Allowing subjects to form new nations
  [*] Subjects are now allowed to use the decisions to form new nations when they are eligible to do so.
  [*] Changing the burgher estate so that your subjects don't add Orthodox tolerance, making it possible to finally convert your subjects.
[/list]

[h2]Fiefs[/h2]
New subject type that is a subset of vassals, only with heavy requirements on being small. This is to simulate the small fiefdoms that were common in the middle ages. The following bonuses are awarded fiefs:

[list]
  [*] +25 Governing Capacity (when your Fief has 1 and only 1 province)
  [*] +1 Diplomatic Relations (when your Fief has 15+ development in its province)
  [*] +5% increased Global Trade Power (when your Fief is landed in an Estuary or Trade Center
[/list]

[h2]Protectorates[/h2]
New subject type that is a subset of vassals, kind of like the opposite of marches. They have a weak military presence, so they instead have a strong economic potency.

[h2]Client States[/h2]
New subject type that sits somewhere between a Personal Union and a Vassal. Their primary strengh lies in being very cheap to eventually annex. They will not be inherited automatically, making them a good way to keep your favourite vassals or unions around until you decide to annex them yourself.

[h2]Viceroyalty[/h2]
New subject type that is kind of an autonomous region. My primary idea behind this subject type was that they should be established once you're kind of finished and want to move on, leaving a subject behind that is yours in all but name. They can be fully integrated with the click of a button. You create viceroyalties from decisions.

[h2]Subject Incorporation[/h2]
I'm also adding the base game ability to further incorporate them into your realm, making them cheaper to annex, and cost no diplomatic relations. Instead they cost a little bit of governing capacity. I've "unlocked" this ability for existing subjects. All subjects retain their incorporation status, even when changing to different subject types.

[h3]Levels[/h3]
The following incorporation levels are available:

[list]
  [*] Incorporated: Annexation cost reduced by 25%, no Diplomatic Relations cost, 50 Governing Capacity cost, 25% chance of inheritance on monarch death.
  [*] Consolidated: Annexation cost reduced by 50%, no Diplomatic Relations cost, 100 Governing Capacity cost, 50% chance of inheritance on monarch death.
[/list]

[h3]Subject Types[/h3]
The following subjects are affected by these changes:

[list]
  [*] Vassals
  [*] Fiefdoms
  [*] Marches
  [*] Protectorates
  [*] Client States
  [*] Personal Unions
[/list]

[h3]Incorporated Personal Union[/h3]
I've added a trigger on monarch death that makes Incorporated Personal Unions more likely to be inherited as long as the normal requirements are met. It's now more of a coinflip if you get the inheritance or not.

[h2]Forming Unions with Vassals[/h2]
There's now a path to forming a union with your vassal. You will have to form your vassal into a client state first, and after that you can form a personal union with them. It is also possible to form a client state from a personal union.
