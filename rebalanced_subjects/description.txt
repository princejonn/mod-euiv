I love subject mechanics. Subjects are fun to play around with, and add some needed depth to the gameplay. It's fun to get autonomous help in wars, and it's fun to feed your subjects and see them grow. There are some things I would like to add though. In this mod I'm aiming to fix and rebalance a couple of things that deal with subjects.

[h2]Features[/h2]
[list]
  [*] New Subject Types
  [*] Subject Incorporation
  [*] Subjects are now allowed to use the decisions to form new nations when they are eligible to do so.
  [*] Changing the burgher estate so that your subjects don't add Orthodox tolerance, making it possible to finally convert your subjects.
[/list]

[h2]New Subject Types[/h2]
[list]
  [*] Gaikoku Daimyo
  [*] Bishopric
  [*] Crusader Order
  [*] Fiefdom
  [*] Protectorate
  [*] Principality
  [*] Sister Republic
  [*] Viceroyalty
[/list]

[h3]Gaikoku Daimyo[/h3]
New subject type for Japan players. It's very much like the current Daimyo subject type, except you get to establish them in regions outside of Japan. It's basically just a bit of flavour. Why would Japan suddenly stop establishing Daimyos and just create Vassals?

[h3]Bishopric[/h3]
New subject type that is a subset of vassals, only with heavy requirements on being small. A territory governed by a bishop, granted by the overlord to the Church in exchange for spiritual support, loyalty, and governance. Bishoprics are autonomous regions with significant religious influence and cannot be annexed. You can only establish Bishoprics on the same continent as the capital. When Bishoprics own 3 or fewer provinces, they award the overlord economid and religious bonuses. You can have 2 Bishoprics.

[h3]Crusader Order[/h3]
New subject type that is a subset of vassals, only with heavy requirements on being small. A territory governed by a religious military order, combining crusader and knightly duties. Granted by the overlord in exchange for loyalty, military service, and religious dedication, these orders are autonomous regions focused on defending the faith and maintaining regional security. Crusader Orders cannot be annexed. You can only establish Crusader Orders when you are the Defender of Faith. You can only establish Crusader Orders in the same region as the capital. When Crusader Orders own 3 or fewer provinces, they award the overlord military bonuses. When Crusader Orders have a capital development of 40 and have the Highest Level Fort available, a Tax Building, a Trade Building, a Production Building, and a Manpower Building, they will gain very strong bonuses to their nation. You can have 1 Crusader Order.

[h3]Fiefdom[/h3]
New subject type that is a subset of vassals, only with heavy requirements on being small. A territory granted by an overlord to a duke in exchange for loyalty, military service, and governance on behalf of the overlord. Fiefdoms cannot be annexed. You can only establish Crusader Orders in the same region as the capital. When Fiefdoms own 2 or fewer provinces, they award the overlord administrative and diplomatic bonuses. You can have 3 Fiefdoms.

[h3]Protectorate[/h3]
New subject type that is a subset of vassals, kind of like the opposite of marches. They have a weak military presence, so they instead have a strong economic potency.

[h3]Principality[/h3]
New subject type for monarchies. It's something of a mix between a Personal Union and a Vassal. You cannot establish a Principality outside of the continent of your capital. Hover the button to see what is required. They are cheaper in cost to Diplomatically Annex. They will not be inherited automatically, making them a good way to keep your favourite vassals or unions around until you decide to annex them yourself. Once you Land a Prince of your dynasty, the country colour will also be changed to yours.

[h3]Sister Republic[/h3]
New subject type for republics. When it comes to subjects, I find that republics have fewer things going for them (in relation to monarchies) so I wanted to add something spicy and fun to the mix. Sister Republics are somewhat reminiscent of Vassals and an Eyalets. They will not automatically join your wars, but you can call them in for favors. You can either diplomatically establish vassals as sister republics, or you can establish them via warfare at a discounted development cost. You cannot establish a Sister Republic outside of the continent of your capital. Hover the button to see what is required. They are cheaper in cost to Diplomatically Annex. Once you establish a Sister Republic, the country colour will also be changed to yours. You can call your Sister Republics into your wars for favors. You can join your Sister Republic wars and gain favours.

[h3]Viceroyalty[/h3]
New subject type for monarchies and republics. It's very close to how an eyalet and a colony works, but with a few differences. You can only establish a Viceroyalty outside of the continent of your capital. They will not automatically join your wars, but you can call them in for favors. All provinces conquered or gained in the Viceroyalty's region will be ceded to the Viceroyalty. You can only have one viceroyalty per region. You can call your Viceroyalties into your wars for favors. You can join your Viceroyalty wars and gain favours.

[h2]Subject Incorporation[/h2]
I'm also adding the base game ability to further incorporate them into your realm, making them cheaper to annex, and cost no diplomatic relations. Instead they cost a little bit of governing capacity. I've "unlocked" this ability for existing subjects.

You acquire the ability to Incorporate subjects via a decision once you have full Influence and Administrative Ideas. You can then choose to either Incorporate your subjects. The decision will cost you 300 Diplomatic Power.

You acquire the ability to Consolidate subjects via a decision once you have full Influence, Administrative, and either Aristocratic or Plutocratic Ideas. You can then choose to either Consolidate your subjects. The decision will cost you 500 Diplomatic Power.

[h3]Levels[/h3]

  [*] Incorporated: Reduced Annexation/Integration cost, no Diplomatic Relations cost, (Capacity cost for Vassals and Client States), (25% chance of inheritance on monarch death for Personal Unions).
  [*] Consolidated: Reduced Annexation/Integration cost, no Diplomatic Relations cost, (Governing Capacity cost for Vassals and Client States), (50% chance of inheritance on monarch death for Personal Unions).
